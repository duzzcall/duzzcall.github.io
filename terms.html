                  by Customer under this Section 5.1 during the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, an early termination

                  conjunction with a cancelled Service Order or termination under this clause may also be subject to a
                  restocking fee. If Customer transfers or ports a Number or Ported Number (as defined in Section 12) to
                  another service provider, Customer must notify DuzzCall in order to cancel any Services related to
                  such Numbers or Ported Numbers or service charges will continue. </dd>

                  charge will apply and disconnection fees and other charges may also apply. </dd>

                  shall be responsible for the full monthly Service Fees for the month in which termination occurs, the
                  following month and any applicable usage charges. Expiration or termination of the Agreement does not
                  alleviate Customer of responsibility for paying all unpaid, accrued charges due hereunder.</dd>

                <dd>6.2. TEXT MESSAGING LIMITATIONS. Text Messages addressed to international destinations outside of US

                  a single device to another single device, and do not support group messaging. In the event that a
                  transmitted Text Message is destined for an address connected to a third party network and that
                  network is unreachable at the time delivery is attempted, the Text Message will be stored and queued
                  for future delivery. Further delivery attempts will be performed based on a configurable time schedule
                  with a specified reasonable number of attempts. DuzzCall will employ commercially reasonable efforts

                (if applicable) and all risk of loss or damage shall pass to Customer upon delivery to carrier. Customer
                will be provided a twelve (12) month manufacturer's warranty from the date of purchase of Equipment or
                Services. Customer shall be required to obtain authorization from DuzzCall to return any Equipment.
                DuzzCall will provide replacement Equipment only if the Equipment is deemed to be defective and covered
                under the warranty. DuzzCall will not cover replacement for lost, stolen or modified Equipment.
                Equipment returned by Customer that is not covered under warranty may be refused by DuzzCall, and
                Customer will be responsible to pay return shipping charges. DuzzCall may refuse to provide Services to
                any party that has purchased refurbished DuzzCall equipment from a third party. </p>

              <p class="mb-4">8. CUSTOMER DATA. Customer hereby grants, subject to Section 22 (Privacy), to DuzzCall a
                non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in connection with an assignment of this Agreement) license to
                copy, store, record, transmit, display, view, print, and use Customer Data, solely to the extent
                necessary to provide the Services to Customer. Except as expressly provided in this Section, Customer
                grants to DuzzCall no right, title, interest, or license in the Customer Data, and Customer hereby
                reserves for itself and its licensors all rights in and to all Customer Data. Notwithstanding the
                foregoing, DuzzCall shall be permitted to disclose Customer Data to third parties as and to the extent
                required by law (including, without limitation, pursuant to a court order or subpoena). </p>

                  Equipment charges, toll charges, taxes and any other applicable charges. Monthly Service Fees are paid
                  in advance of each month's Service; toll charges and any other applicable charges are billed

                  Customer provides DuzzCall with an appropriate exemption certificate. If any amounts paid for the

                    above, DuzzCall may, in its sole discretion, charge the following disconnection fees:<br>
                    If a Customer terminates a Service Plan (excluding a Plus Extension) associated with Equipment
                    within four (4) months of the initial purchase of the Services, DuzzCall shall charge a service
                    disconnection fee equivalent to the list price of each item of Equipment minus any fees paid
                    expressly for Equipment at the time of the initial purchase.<br>
                    If a Customer terminates a Service Plan (excluding a Plus Extension) associated with Equipment
                    within twelve (12) months of the initial purchase of the Services, DuzzCall shall charge a service
                    disconnection fee of fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents ($59.99) for each item of
                    Equipment.<br>
                    If a Customer terminates a Plus Extension Service Plan within twenty-four (24) months of the initial
                    purchase of the Services, DuzzCall shall charge a disconnection fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00)
                    for each Plus Extension.<br>
                    If a Customer terminates an Extended Payment Plan within twenty-four (24) months of the initial
                    shipment of the related Equipment or such other Initial Term specified in the Service Order,
                    Customer shall immediately pay to DuzzCall the monthly amount due for the subject Equipment
                    multiplied by the number of months remaining in the terminated Extended Payment Plan term on the
                    date of termination.<br>
                    In the event the foregoing disconnection fees exceed the early termination charge otherwise
                    applicable under paragraph (A) above, such disconnection fees shall automatically be charged in lieu
                    of the early termination charge. Disconnection fees shall be invoiced to Customer when Customer
                    notifies DuzzCall of the cancellation of the Services. The Virtual Office Pro Softphone Edition and
                    Virtual Office Solo plans are on month-to-month agreements and are not subject to the disconnection
                    fee.</dd>
                  <dd>C. OVERAGE AND OTHER CHARGES. If the Terminated Term is the Initial Term, DuzzCall will also
                    charge Customer, and Customer will pay, any unpaid non-recurring charges waived at the beginning of
                    the Initial Term. DuzzCall reserves the right to charge overage fees when Customer exceeds the usage
                    limits on applicable services, including, but not limited to, recording services on Virtual Meeting
                    licenses and Virtual Office Pro extensions. </dd>
                  <dd>D. SERVICE DOWNGRADES. A Customer may not reduce the number of lines or seats, or the number of
                    services, provided under a Service Plan during the Initial Term or any Renewal Term without
                    DuzzCall's consent unless otherwise provided in the Agreement. Any reduction in the number of lines
                    or seats under a Service Plan shall be treated as a termination of Service under this Section 10.7
                    with respect to those lines or seats. Any reduction or downgrading of Services shall be treated as a
                    termination of Service under this Section 10.7 with respect to the applicable Services. DuzzCall's
                    acceptance of any proposed reduction in lines, seats or services shall not release customer from its
                    obligations to pay applicable fees and charges under this Section 10.7 unless DuzzCall expressly
                    agrees in writing to waive such fees and charges.</dd>
                </dl>
                <dd>9.8. RATE CHANGES. Rates will not be increased during the Initial Term, with the exception of tax or
                  fee changes and international toll calling rates. Otherwise, DuzzCall may change the prices for the
                  Services, toll charges, fees and taxes, from time to time. In the event of a change in prices or toll
                  charges, DuzzCall will post such changes to its website currently located athttps://www.DuzzCall.com.
                  International toll calling rates are updated monthly on the first of each month and no other notice
                  shall be provided for changes to international toll calling rates. The Service Fees effective upon any
                  renewal of the Agreement shall be DuzzCall's then-current Service Fees for the applicable Services.
                </dd>
                <dd>9.9. DISCOUNTS. From time to time in its sole discretion, DuzzCall may offer promotions or discounts
                  of activation or other fees. Any promotion or discount codes must be provided to DuzzCall upon
                  purchase of the Services. Customer shall not be entitled to a subsequent credit for such promotions or
                  discounts, if not requested at the time of account creation or change of service. Promotions and/or
                  discounts may not be used cumulatively or be used for services retroactively. Promotions may be
                  changed at DuzzCall's sole discretion. </dd>
                <dd>9.10. BILLING DISPUTES. Customer must dispute any charges for the Services in writing to DuzzCall
                  within thirty (30) days of the date of the charge by DuzzCall. If Customer fails to provide a written
                  statement disputing the charges within such time, Customer waives any objection and further recourse
                  with regard to such charges. Written statements disputing charges must be sent to claims@duzzcall.com
                </dd>
              </dl>

              <p class="mb-2">10. TOLL CHARGES. Every call using the Services that originates or terminates in the
                Public Switched Telephone Network ("PSTN"), including other VoIP networks, is subject to the then
                applicable toll charges that are associated with the Service Plan, which DuzzCall will include in bills
                and Customer will pay. For Customers subscribed to Virtual Contact Center ("VCC") Services, every PSTN
                call to or from a VCC tenant and to or from a VCC agent is subject to applicable toll charges at
                DuzzCall's then current rates or as otherwise specified in a Service Order. Calls to a non-DuzzCall
                telephone phone number outside the United States and Canada will be charged at the current rates
                published on the DuzzCall website. The duration of each call is to be calculated in one-minute
                increments and rounded up to the nearest one-minute increment for any fraction of minutes used. If the
                computed charge for a call includes a fraction of a cent, the fraction is rounded up to the nearest
                whole cent When Customer dials an international PSTN phone number, charges may apply regardless of
                whether the party on the other line answers the call. Calls made by a Customer to an international
                mobile, rather than landline, or premium rate telephone number, may result in higher toll charges.
                Charges to Customer for inbound toll free numbers are subject to the geographic restrictions and
                location of the person calling into the toll free number.</p>

              <p class="mb-2">11. TELEPHONE NUMBER. Any telephone number provided by DuzzCall ("Number") to Customer
                shall be leased and not sold. Customer will not use the Number with any other device other than the
                Equipment without the express written permission of DuzzCall. Except with regard to telephone numbers
                which had been assigned to Customer by another service provider and then ported to DuzzCall ("Ported
                Numbers"), DuzzCall reserves the right to change, cancel or move Numbers in its reasonable discretion.
                Upon termination of the Services under Section 5.1 and at Customer's request, DuzzCall will employ
                commercially reasonable efforts to assist Customer to port out the Numbers and the Ported Numbers and
                DuzzCall will charge a port out fee of $5.00 per Number or Ported Number. Customer acknowledges that the
                porting of all Numbers and Ported Numbers is dependent upon the cooperation of third parties not under
                the control of DuzzCall.</p>

              <p class="mb-2">12. MONITORING SERVICES USE. Customer agrees that DuzzCall is entitled to monitor
                Customer's use of Service, at DuzzCall's expense. Customer may also be subject to a preliminary fraud
                review and approval process for select DuzzCall services.</p>

              <p class="mb-2">13. LOST, STOLEN, ALTERED OR BROKEN EQUIPMENT. Customer shall not modify the Equipment
                in any way without the express written permission of DuzzCall. Customer shall not use the Equipment
                except
                with the Services provided hereunder. Except as otherwise provided for hereunder, Customer is
                responsible
                for all lost, stolen or broken Equipment and may be required to purchase a replacement to continue to
                use
                the Services. Replacement charges will be based on the fair retail price of Equipment, plus applicable
                shipping costs and taxes. Customer shall immediately notify DuzzCall of any lost or stolen Equipment and
                shall cooperate with DuzzCall in all reasonable aspects to eliminate actual or potential unauthorized
                use
                of the Equipment. At DuzzCall's sole option, failure to report lost or stolen Equipment in a timely
                manner
                will cause Customer to be responsible for all Service Fees accrued until the time that DuzzCall is
                informed of the loss or theft and DuzzCall is entitled to terminate the Services and Agreement following
                Customer's breach of this Section. Equipment not provided by DuzzCall shall not be used by Customer
                unless
                specifically agreed to in writing by DuzzCall. Equipment not provided by DuzzCall shall not be supported
                by DuzzCall.</p>

              <p class="mb-2">14. PROHIBITED USES.</p>
              <dl class="ml-4 mb-4">
                <dd>14.1. GENERAL. Any use of the Services or any other action that causes a disruption in the network

                  other governmental proceeding or process, including without limitation a law enforcement proceeding,
                  process, or inquiry. Customer acknowledges that neither DuzzCall nor its vendors are responsible for
                  the content of the transmissions that may pass through the Internet and/or the Services. Any use found
                  to be inconsistent with the restrictions of this Section 15 will result in termination of the Services
                  without prejudice to any other remedies DuzzCall may have. DuzzCall may request a valid business
                  license from Customer upon reasonable suspicion of misconduct by Customer, and failure to provide a
                  valid business license may result in termination of Service. </dd>

                  Services and the Equipment (if any) for its own internal use only, and shall not resell, transfer or

                  applicable local, state, national or international statute, regulation, or other law. Without limiting
